              " 'After 2 months with our beloved baby girl, whom we took home from the hospital 2 days after her birth, we are convinced that we will NOT accept an open adoption when we adopt our second child.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>We initially declined to be involved with an open adoption but our Adoption Agency was very pro-open and we were too desperate to say no. The match was perfect for us - no drugs, alcohol, and a healthy birth mother.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>However, it soon became clear that we bit off more than we can chew:\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mom/grand mom repeatedly insisting that we accept their Facebook friend requests. We already gave them our personal cell phone numbers but they wanted Facebook.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mother who insists on referring to my daughter as &quot;her daughter&quot; and refers to her by the birth mother&#39;s given name for the little girl.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mother making constant posts on Facebook about &quot;her daughter&quot;, posting pictures of her.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mother getting a tattoo of the little girl&#39;s name\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth grandparents repeatedly asking to video chat with our daughter\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Absolutely horrific hospital experience. Our (well-paid!) adoption agency was not present which lead to 4 very long days of Birth Mom/Grandparents extremely bizarre behavior and demands that we stay in the hospital before our daughter was even born.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>Now none of these things would deter me from doing it all over again for my incredible daughter. But this is the easy part. Everything leads me to believe that these boundaries will continue to be crossed well into the age where my daughter will begin to understand what it is to be adopted. Everything that I have seen so far leads me to believe that these birth mom/grand parents want their cake and to eat it too. Based on the terrible decisions the birth grandparents are making for their daughter (birth mom), I have no reason to believe that good judgment will be made regarding my daughter and as such I am EXTREMELY concerned about future visits. <div class=\"newline\"></div>Since it is so early and I know birth mom is still healing, I am willing to let a lot pass right now. But if this hovering doesn&#39;t start to fade in a year or two, my wife and I will have to exercise the &quot;what&#39;s best for our daughter&quot; clause in our visitation contract and deny them access to her.\\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>I am only writing this as a word of caution to those couples out there who are considering an open adoption. </div>',\n",

Most parents that agree to open adoption are very understanding, accommodating, and simply want the best for their child. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>I did open adoption over two decades ago when it was still a new concept. I was blessed to find wonderful parents for my child. And yes, the child will always be mine. I grew the baby for 9 months and we&#39;re genetically bonded. Not to mention I chose the difficult route of adoption out of pure love and selflessness. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>I&#39;m grateful for contact the parents gave me over the years because it helped me have closure and move on. In fact, I&#39;ve probably given too little contact for the parent&#39;s preferences. Nonetheless, my child has had a fulfilling life with their family and has no questions or resentment thanks to the contact we&#39;ve kept over the years. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>Setting proper boundaries are one thing, but the amount of resentment and callousness in OP&#39;s posts are disgusting. They are not acting in the child&#39;s best interests by having that attitude. And to think the child is 5 now and likely being influenced by OP&#39;s hatred for the bio mom & her family. Yikes, poor kid. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>That&#39;s going to be a train wreck when that child is older. Not even from a lack of contact with the bio family but because of OP&#39;s hateful attitude which will be passed on to the child.

I&#39;m a very plain spoken guy that doesn&#39;t pull any punches when it comes to my family and doing everything I can to protect them. I have a client who grew up in foster care and he was the first to warn me against the notion of an open adoption. He confirmed my suspicion that it&#39;s nothing but trouble as the child goes home, gets torn between his birth mother, then gets forced to go back to his adoptive parents. Often, the birth parents insist on interfering with the adoptive parent&#39;s efforts to correct the child or how the child is being raised, which opens up a whole new can of worms. I finally heard enough that I felt comfortable telling the social worker that if the birth parents aren&#39;t so bad that I would have to endure them interfering with my family life, then they should send the child back to live with his parents. I&#39;m hearing more and more stories of open adoptions gone wrong. Just the day before yesterday, a birth mother stole her infant son from foster care. Once the home is too bad of a place for the child, that should be it. If the parents are working on bettering themselves, then the child shouldn&#39;t be adopted. He should return home once his parents get their act together. It creates too much drama and does more damage to the kid to tear them back and forth constantly. </div>',\n",

In foster care adoptions sometimes one may need to protect more from risks than what a private adoption might require, especially if a child has had difficulty forming attachments due to being moved allot. However, it is important to see both your child and the bio family members as human beings first and foremost. It is natural for a child to want to know where they came from, why they were adopted and whether or not they have other siblings who share their biological make up, their DNA. Openly degrading one&#8217;s family of origin is psychologically harmful to children and teens as they are unable to reconcile a parent who says they love them and care about them telling them they came from someone who was no good, worthless, &#8220;nasty&#8221;. It makes one feel like you are saying that they are descended from refuse...NO! Each child is descended from human beings, yes imperfect human beings with their own challenges and issues, but they are still human beings, and should you be blessed enough to find a good match for you, it will be because that human being though imperfect gave the child the gift of life, which is a gift that any adoptive parent should be grateful for because without that life your arms might just remain empty. </div>',\n",

The match was perfect for us - no drugs, alcohol, and a healthy birth mother.\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>However, it soon became clear that we bit off more than we can chew:\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mom/grand mom repeatedly insisting that we accept their Facebook friend requests. We already gave them our personal cell phone numbers but they wanted Facebook.\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mother who insists on referring to my daughter as &quot;her daughter&quot; and refers to her by the birth mother&#39;s given name for the little girl.\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mother making constant posts on Facebook about &quot;her daughter&quot;, posting pictures of her.\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth mother getting a tattoo of the little girl&#39;s name\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Birth grandparents repeatedly asking to video chat with our daughter\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>-Absolutely horrific hospital experience. Our (well-paid!) adoption agency was not present which lead to 4 very long days of Birth Mom/Grandparents extremely bizarre behavior and demands that we stay in the hospital before our daughter was even born.\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>Now none of these things would deter me from doing it all over again for my incredible daughter. But this is the easy part. Everything leads me to believe that these boundaries will continue to be crossed well into the age where my daughter will begin to understand what it is to be adopted. Everything that I have seen so far leads me to believe that these birth mom/grand parents want their cake and to eat it too. Based on the terrible decisions the birth grandparents are making for their daughter (birth mom), I have no reason to believe that good judgment will be made regarding my daughter and as such I am EXTREMELY concerned about future visits. <div class=\"newline\"></div>Since it is so early and I know birth mom is still healing, I am willing to let a lot pass right now. But if this hovering doesn&#39;t start to fade in a year or two, my wife and I will have to exercise the &quot;what&#39;s best for our daughter&quot; clause in our visitation contract and deny them access to her.\r<div class=\"newline\"></div>I am only writing this as a word of caution to those couples out there who are considering an open adoption. </div>\n",

Most parents that agree to open adoption are very understanding, accommodating, and simply want the best for their child. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>I did open adoption over two decades ago when it was still a new concept. I was blessed to find wonderful parents for my child. And yes, the child will always be mine. I grew the baby for 9 months and we&#39;re genetically bonded. Not to mention I chose the difficult route of adoption out of pure love and selflessness. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>I&#39;m grateful for contact the parents gave me over the years because it helped me have closure and move on. In fact, I&#39;ve probably given too little contact for the parent&#39;s preferences. Nonetheless, my child has had a fulfilling life with their family and has no questions or resentment thanks to the contact we&#39;ve kept over the years. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>Setting proper boundaries are one thing, but the amount of resentment and callousness in OP&#39;s posts are disgusting. They are not acting in the child&#39;s best interests by having that attitude. And to think the child is 5 now and likely being influenced by OP&#39;s hatred for the bio mom & her family. Yikes, poor kid. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>That&#39;s going to be a train wreck when that child is older. Not even from a lack of contact with the bio family but because of OP&#39;s hateful attitude which will be passed on to the child.

Why should someone who&#39;s trying to provide a stable loving home have to deal with all that drama just to pacify someone who can&#39;t keep her feet on the floor or stay out of jail? If that&#39;s nasty, good. It was meant to be nasty because often these are nasty people who will do everything in their power to make you not want the child and send it back to them. It&#39;s bad practice for the everyone in the equation.<div class=\"newline\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>Are you adopting from foster care? In foster care adoptions sometimes one may need to protect more from risks than what a private adoption might require, especially if a child has had difficulty forming attachments due to being moved allot. However, it is important to see both your child and the bio family members as human beings first and foremost. It is natural for a child to want to know where they came from, why they were adopted and whether or not they have other siblings who share their biological make up, their DNA. Openly degrading one&#8217;s family of origin is psychologically harmful to children and teens as they are unable to reconcile a parent who says they love them and care about them telling them they came from someone who was no good, worthless, &#8220;nasty&#8221;. It makes one feel like you are saying that they are descended from refuse...NO! Each child is descended from human beings, yes imperfect human beings with their own challenges and issues, but they are still human beings, and should you be blessed enough to find a good match for you, it will be because that human being though imperfect gave the child the gift of life, which is a gift that any adoptive parent should be grateful for because without that life your arms might just remain empty. </div>\n",

Everyone that commented on here wrote wonderful advice about how an adoption is NOT just like having a natural birth. How do these couples that are so ready to have a baby do such awful research on what they will go through AND the birth family per different agreement. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>To deny your kid their birth family because you think this is all about you and having &quot;your family&quot; is fcked up. It takes a real loving family, one that doesn&#39;t immaturely/dishonestly/rudely/ and cruelly accept terms to an open adoption, to understand that even if they realized it was easier for them to be closed--&gt;THEY made a mistake and now they should be good people to the ones that gave them their child. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>To the guy that wrote this post: when love is shared, it multiplies. My mom tells me everyday &quot;you are me&quot; even though we are nothing alike. Try to understand that when this person birthed her baby, her bones/flesh/veins/arteries, she became a mother. She gave her baby to you with trusting arms. Yes she gave her baby away, but she is still a mother. She is the mother of that child, and you made a terrible decision by telling her that she will be able to be in the childs life. Fucking kidnappers if you ask me. Honestly, blame it on your wifes infertility. Don&#39;t go coocoo crazy and get all papa bear and cut everyone off like a heartless low class fowl man. Children are not possessions. Even to Biological Parent-parents, they are never possessions. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>I do not understand this pathetic need of people that can&#39;t conceive to be so protective when they get custody of someone&#39;s child. insecurity is a pretty lame reason given that were talking about unconditional love here. <div class=\"newline\"></div>She handed you her infant. You should respect her and let her know how her daughter is doing. Let her know her interests, because believe it or not, your little girl is going to be a lot like her mother. In many ways like you, and in undoubtable ways like her. That little girl you love so much, is a tiny version of her real mommy. A woman that thinks about her everyday, and if she has any pain at all, it is that the people raising her child have kicked her to the side. She is not a baby machine. She is her mother. The decisions you made were wrong, and the way you think she is disposable is wrong. <div class=\"newline\"></div><div class=\"newline\"></div>And let me make one thing very clear for you, since obviously not having any biological kids affects your thinking. Her mother will never forget about her, nor will she be permanently out of her life (unless she died). She didn&#39;t get her name tatted on her arm for no reason. The way you assume she &quot;lost interest&quot; is disgusting to me. Is that what your going to tell your &quot;precious baby girl&quot; when she finds out your not her birth parents?

I appreciate the fact that you are sticking to what you agreed to for your open adoption plan. That&#39;s amazing. Personally, I know that she was probably very anxious about the visit which led to drug usage which then led to her being excessively late. In my opinion, the one thing that worked for me was tough love. The parents of my child knew it wasn&#39;t a good idea for me to be around my child while I was still using drugs. Now that I&#39;m sober I 100% agree with that. I know it&#39;s going to hurt her and she will say she hates you but until she can get sober you should probably stop visits. You could try to do 1 more visit and see how she looks and if she shows up and determine from there what the future will hold. Continue to send photos and letters though. It won&#39;t be good for your son to see his birth mother in a bad state. I hope she gets the help she needs and gets sober. i&#39;m sorry you guys are having to go through this. </div>\n"

I&#39;m a very plain spoken guy that doesn&#39;t pull any punches when it comes to my family and doing everything I can to protect them. I have a client who grew up in foster care and he was the first to warn me against the notion of an open adoption. He confirmed my suspicion that it&#39;s nothing but trouble as the child goes home, gets torn between his birth mother, then gets forced to go back to his adoptive parents. Often, the birth parents insist on interfering with the adoptive parent&#39;s efforts to correct the child or how the child is being raised, which opens up a whole new can of worms. I finally heard enough that I felt comfortable telling the social worker that if the birth parents aren&#39;t so bad that I would have to endure them interfering with my family life, then they should send the child back to live with his parents. I&#39;m hearing more and more stories of open adoptions gone wrong. Just the day before yesterday, a birth mother stole her infant son from foster care.

            "we are looking to adopt as well. our social worker insisted that we consider open adoption. my reply was very short and to the point-over my dead body. i&#39;m a very plain spoken guy that doesn&#39;t pull any punches when it comes to my family and doing everything i can to protect them. i have a client who grew up in foster care and he was the first to warn me against the notion of an open adoption. he confirmed my suspicion that it&#39;s nothing but trouble as the child goes home, gets torn between his birth mother, then gets forced to go back to his adoptive parents. often, the birth parents insist on interfering with the adoptive parent&#39;s efforts to correct the child or how the child is being raised, which opens up a whole new can of worms. i finally heard enough that i felt comfortable telling the social worker that if the birth parents aren&#39;t so bad that i would have to endure them interfering with my family life, then they should send the child back to live with his parents. i&#39;m hearing more and more stories of open adoptions gone wrong. just the day before yesterday, a birth mother stole her infant son from foster care. once the home is too bad of a place for the child, that should be it. if the parents are working on bettering themselves, then the child shouldn&#39;t be adopted. he should return home once his parents get their act together. it creates too much drama and does more damage to the kid to tear them back and forth constantly. \n",

In foster care adoptions sometimes one may need to protect more from risks than what a private adoption might require, especially if a child has had difficulty forming attachments due to being moved allot. However, it is important to see both your child and the bio family members as human beings first and foremost. It is natural for a child to want to know where they came from, why they were adopted and whether or not they have other siblings who share their biological make up, their DNA.

She responded to my last inquiry about a visit and we agreed to a place and time. At the agreed upon time, she texted that she was running 30 min late, then she texted 30 minutes later that she was just 20 more min late, then it was 15 min, then 5 min, then another 20 min, and so on until it had been 3 hours and 45 minutes. At that point, it was getting close to his bedtime and I texted her that we had to leave (he was fine chilling for those 3 hours and 45 min, we were somewhere he likes, he&#39;s a baby so if he&#39;s getting his bottles and someone he likes is with him he&#39;s pretty much good). 15 min after that she texted &quot;Where are you I&#39;m here?!&quot; I then got a butt dial from her and could hear her asking people if they had seen us and explaining she was supposed to meet her son&#39;s adoptive parents.

In my opinion, the one thing that worked for me was tough love. The parents of my child knew it wasn&#39;t a good idea for me to be around my child while I was still using drugs. Now that I&#39;m sober I 100% agree with that. I know it&#39;s going to hurt her and she will say she hates you but until she can get sober you should probably stop visits. You could try to do 1 more visit and see how she looks and if she shows up and determine from there what the future will hold. Continue to send photos and letters though.
